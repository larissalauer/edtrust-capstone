    <h2 style="text-align: center;">DATASCI 192A/B Final Report (Spring 2025)</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Authors: Michelle Chen, Sebastian Kane, and Larissa Lauer</h3>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      EdTrust’s mission is to advance policies and practices to dismantle the racial and economic barriers 
      embedded in the American education system. We approached our research project with the goal of addressing 
      larger systemic issues with American higher education. 
      <br> <br>
      Return on investment (ROI) frameworks inform educational policies and help prospective students and their 
      families plan for higher education, so the way in which ROI is calculated and presented is extremely important
      in determining which institutions receive more or less funding, resources, and students. Current ROI frameworks
      largely focus on a purely economic model (most often, a debt-to-earnings ratio), which neglects student body
      characteristics that also influence post-graduate success.  
      <br><br> 
      Our research fills a critical gap in existing ROI frameworks by specifically examining how the calculation of ROI 
      changes for Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) when controlling for 
      key student body characteristics. Traditional models assess ROI at the institutional or program level but often 
      overlook how institutional type intersects with student demographics, socioeconomic status, and structural barriers 
      like labor market discrimination. By integrating factors like student body characteristics into our analysis, we aim 
      to determine whether disparities in ROI persist due to institutional differences or broader systemic inequities. 
      Our refined approach provides a more accurate and equitable measure of postsecondary value, ensuring a fairer 
      assessment of institutions that serve historically underrepresented students. Our findings would not only sharpen ROI 
      calculations but also inform policy debates on funding and resource allocation between MSIs and PWIs.

    <h2>Institution-Level Data</h2>
    
    <p>
      The following dataset provides information on the ROI of colleges and universities in the United States for each 
      framework of interest. We include other relevant variables, such as the percentage of students receiving Pell 
      Grants (an indicator of socioeconomic status), MSI type, and racial demographics. We primarily relied on 
      <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">College Scorecard data</a> 
      to construct this dataset and calculate the measures of ROI. 
    <p> 
      <h2>How to Use This Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        You can sort the columns of this table in ascending order and descending order to see which institutions have the 
        most extreme values. If you are interested in recreating or further developing our regression analysis, click 
        “Download Dataset” below the table to save a copy of it to your device.
        <br><br>
        Prospective students and parents may also be interested in the ROI of specific schools. These schools can also be 
        found using the search bar. See the discussion below for details on interpreting specific ROI frameworks. 
        <br><br>
        We want to caution against blindly relying on ROI measures as indicators of a school’s quality or of the return 
        a student should expect from attending. Indeed, a central finding of our research is that existing ROI frameworks 
        can conflate the individual return on investment a student can realistically expect with the advantages already conferred 
        by their socioeconomic background. In other words, a high ROI may indicate that an institution effectively contributes to 
        student success and career outcomes or that its student body comes from backgrounds that often lead to higher earnings 
        regardless of the institution attended. In the absence of detailed individual-level data on earnings, background, and 
        college of attendance, more work is needed to produce informative and accurate measures of ROI that do not rely on 
        questionable assumptions.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Third Way's Price to Earnings Premium (PEP) Model</h2>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Calculation Framework</h2>
    
      <p>
        Third Way’s Price-to-Earnings Premium (PEP) Model is a way to understand whether going to a specific college is worth the cost, by calculating how long it would take for the average student who graduates in 4 years to recoup, or “earn back” the money they spent on their degree. For some schools, the average student is never expected to recoup the cost of their degree, because graduates don’t make more money than the average high school graduate in their state; in other words, students from these schools make the same amount of money with their degree as they would have had they never graduated college in the first place.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The original calculation, created by Third Way, uses the following formula:
      </p>

        <div style="background-color: #fff9db; border-left: 6px solid #ffe066; padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;">
          <p>
            $$\textbf{Number of years to recoup net cost} = \frac{(\text{Total average net price} \times 4 \text{ years})}{(\text{Post-enrollment earnings} - \text{Typical high school salary})}$$
          </p>
        </div>
    
      <p>
        This calculation results in negative results for institutions where the typical salary of a graduate from that institution is less than the typical salary of a high school graduate in the same state. Therefore, if an institution has a negative PEP-ROI score, the average graduate of this institution will never recoup the cost of their degree. The more negative the number, the larger the gap in earnings for graduates of the institution and high school graduates. If the institution has a positive PEP-ROI score, the value of the score translates to the number of years it would take the average student to recoup the cost of their credential.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        For this analysis, we consider the “best value” schools to be ones where the cost of the credential is recouped quickly, in just a few years. This means that the strength of an institution’s PEP-ROI score increases as its number shrinks towards 0 years to recoup cost. However, that pattern changes at 0, since a PEP-ROI score less than 0 is a very weak score. This feature of Third Way’s original calculation of PEP-ROI scores makes it much harder to conduct statistical analysis of institutions’ ROI data.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        To deal with this, we made an adjustment to the original formula. By taking the inverse of the PEP-ROI score (so 1 divided by the original score), we get scores such that an increase in modified PEP-ROI score translates to a “better value” for an institution. This solves the problem we were facing with the original PEP-ROI score because the interpretation of our modified PEP-ROI scores is consistent for both positive and negative values.
      </p>
    
      <p>To recap, our modified calculation for PEP-ROI is:</p>

      <div style="background-color: #fff9db; border-left: 6px solid #ffe066; padding: 12px; margin: 10px 0;">
        <p>
          $$\textbf{Modified PEP-ROI} = \frac{(\text{Post-enrollment earnings} - \text{Typical high school salary})}{(\text{Total average net price} \times 4 \text{ years})}$$
        </p>
      </div>

      <hr>
    
      <h3>Relevant Variables</h3>
    
      <p>To build this model, we used data from two main sources:</p>
    
      <h4>College Scorecard Data (Institution-level data):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><code>STABBR</code>: The state where the college is located.</li>
        <li><code>MN_EARN_WNE_P10</code>: Average earnings of college graduates 10 years after they started college.</li>
        <li><code>NPT4_PUB</code>: Average yearly cost of attendance for public colleges.</li>
        <li><code>NPT4_PRIV</code>: Average yearly cost of attendance for private colleges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We multiplied the average yearly cost by 4 to estimate the full cost of a 4-year degree.</p>
    
      <h4>Third Way 2023 Data:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Median State Salaries with Positive Earnings (High School Diploma or Equivalent)</code>: This gives the typical income for high school graduates in each state, which we use for comparison.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Figure 1: Distribution of PEP-ROI by MSI Type</h3>
    <p>
      This boxplot shows the distribution of PEP Return on Investment (ROI) values across different types of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Non-MSIs. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of PEP-ROI values for that group, with the thick horizontal line indicating the median.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AANAPII</strong> and <strong>HSI</strong> institutions tend to show slightly positive median PEP-ROI values, indicating better returns compared to others.</li>
      <li><strong>TRIBAL</strong> colleges show a notably lower distribution, with a median well below zero, suggesting significantly lower PEP-ROI performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-MSI</strong> schools center closer to zero, with a broader distribution indicating varied outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Trends across Demographic Groups</h2>
    <img src="peproi_demographic_features_plot.png" alt="Description of image" style="display:block; margin:auto; width:50%;">
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Figure 2: PEP-ROI and Demographic Features</h3>
        <p>
          This plot presents regression coefficients for demographic features predicting PEP-ROI, comparing two models: <strong>Original</strong> (blue) and <strong>With Pell</strong> (orange). Each point shows the estimated effect of a 1 percentage point increase in demographic composition on PEP-ROI, relative to White undergraduate enrollment. Error bars indicate confidence intervals.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Higher Asian %</strong> is associated with significantly <strong>positive</strong> effects on PEP-ROI in both models.</li>
          <li><strong>Higher AIAN %</strong>, <strong>NHPI %</strong>, and <strong>Black %</strong> are associated with <strong>negative</strong> effects, particularly NHPI, which shows large uncertainty due to a small sample size.</li>
          <li><strong>Hispanic %</strong> shows near-zero effect in both models.</li>
          <li>When <strong>Pell eligibility</strong> is added (orange), effect sizes are somewhat attenuated, suggesting that Pell status mediates part of the relationship between race/ethnicity and ROI.</li>
          <li>The <strong>PELL %</strong> variable itself has a <strong>negative</strong> coefficient, suggesting that institutions serving more Pell-eligible students tend to see lower PEP-ROIs, holding other factors constant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This plot underscores how student body composition relates to institutional returns and suggests that socioeconomic factors (like Pell eligibility) partially account for racial/ethnic disparities.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Postsecondary Value Commission ROI Frameworks</h2>
    <p>
      In the following sections, we highlight the major results from our analysis of 
      <a href="https://www.postsecondaryvalue.org/our-work/measuring-value/" target="_blank">ROI frameworks from the Postsecondary Value Commission</a>. 
      These frameworks have two parts: an institution’s ROI score and a binary indicator for whether the school meets 
      a certain threshold. For each framework, we first ran an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model to measure the 
      relationship between MSI type and ROI. We consider the following MSI designations: 
      <ul>
        <li>Historically Black College or University (HBCU)</li>
        <li>Predominantly Black Institution (PBI)</li>
        <li>Alaska Native-/Native Hawaiian-Serving Institution (ANNHI)</li>
        <li>Tribal College or University (TRIBAL)</li>
        <li>Asian American-/Native American-Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPII)</li>
        <li>Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI)</li>
        <li>Native American Non-Tribal Institution (NASNTI)</li>
      </ul>
      We present the model results in plots that show the coefficient for each variable (in this case, each MSI type) and the associated 
      95% confidence interval. We also tested the appropriateness of each model and used robust standard errors where relevant, though we 
      omit detailed discussion for brevity. Because our analysis draws on a comprehensive dataset of all U.S. colleges rather than a 
      sampled subset, effect sizes are more meaningful than confidence intervals in interpreting the results. For OLS models in which 
      ROI is regressed on the MSI variables, each coefficient can be interpreted as the expected ROI for attending a given MSI type above 
      the expected ROI for attending a non-MSI school. A positive effect, therefore, indicates that an MSI type performs better than 
      non-MSIs on average, and a negative effect indicates worse average performance.
      <br> <br>
      We then ran that same model but included an additional variable for the percentage of students at an institution that receive a 
      Pell Grant, which is a poxy for the student body’s general socioeconomic status. The coefficient for Pell Grant percentage can be 
      interpreted as the expected increase in ROI for a one percent increase in the percentage of students receiving Pell Grants, holding 
      other variables constant. We are particularly interested in the difference between the Pell Grant and non-Pell Grant models. If the 
      coefficients for MSI variables shift between models, this would suggest that some of the apparent differences in ROI associated with 
      MSI status might actually be due to differences in the economic background of students. 
      <br> <br>
      We also considered student body race and ethnicity variables instead of MSI type indicators. Because the classification of schools 
      into different MSI types is based on the percentage of students from certain backgrounds 
      (<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2008/2008156.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">generally ≥ 25%, except for HBCUs & TCUs</a>), 
      it may be more informative to use demographic percentages rather than simplified dichotomous variables. These variables can better 
      incorporate the continuous variation in student body composition across institutions and provide a more nuanced understanding of 
      how demographic features relate to ROI. We used the following demographic variables: Black %, Hispanic %, Asian %, AIAN % (American 
      Indian or Alaska Native), and NHPI % (Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). Similar to Pell percentage, coefficients can be 
      interpreted as the expected increase in ROI for a one percent increase in the percentage of students of a given race/ethnicity 
      at a school, controlling for the other variables.
      <br> <br>
      We also performed similar analyses using logit regression to model whether a school meets an ROI threshold as a function of Pell 
      percentage, MSI type, and race/ethnicity percentages. While these threshold-based approaches offer a straightforward way to evaluate 
      institutional performance, they simplify the continuous ROI metrics into binary outcomes, potentially masking meaningful differences 
      across schools. For this reason, we prioritize the OLS results and recommend against overly relying on dichotomous variables when 
      analyzing ROI.
      <br> <br>
      Interpretation of coefficients for logit models is less straightforward than with OLS models. They now represent the log odds of a 
      school meeting the threshold. To provide some intuition for interpreting these log odds, we outline how different log-odd values 
      translate into odds. A log odds of 0 corresponds to a 50/50 chance of meeting the threshold. 0.2 corresponds to about a 5:4 odds 
      of meeting the threshold, and -0.2 to about a 4:5 odds. Similarly, 0.4 corresponds to about a 3:2 odds, and -0.4 to about a 2:3 odds.
      <br> <br>
      In the rest of this article, we outline each ROI framework, briefly review our main findings, and, at the end, provide some overall 
      takeaways.

      <li> Tribal Colleges stand out as being far less likely to meet Threshold 0 than 
      other institutions. This holds true across both the reduced model and model with 
      Pell Grant percentage. The difference is large and meaningful, suggesting that 
      these colleges may be facing major challenges. </li>
      <li>Other types of MSIs (such as HBCUs, HSIs, PBIs, etc.) don’t show strong

        Next, we estimate how controlling for the share of Pell Grant recipients shifts the relative
        earnings premium across different Minority‑Serving Institution (MSI) types.

          <strong>HBCUs:</strong> Move from underperforming to outperforming non‑MSI schools
          (≈ +$7,000) once Pell % is included.

      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the impact of controlling for Pell % is heterogeneous. Because MSI classification is based on
        whether each subgroup exceeds a fixed threshold (typically ≥ 25 %), using continuous
        demographic percentages could yield more nuanced insights than a simple binary flag.

      <h2>Threshold 1: Regression Model with Demographics</h2>
      <p>
        We replace the MSI flags with continuous demographic shares—% Asian, % Black,
        % Hispanic, etc.—to see how each group’s concentration relates to earnings once Pell %
        is controlled.

      />
      <p>
        Despite the smaller x-axis in this new figure, the effects of demographic percentages are still quite 
        substantial. For example, a 1% increase in Pell students is associated with a $320 decrease in 
        expected earnings. Assuming an approximately linear relationship (as tests of curvilinear models 
        suggest the linear model provides a reasonably good fit), a school with 30% more students with Pell 
        Grants is associated with students earning nearly $10,000 less on average ten years after enrollment. 
        <br><br>
        Aside from Asian students, controlling for Pell % amplifies the positive association 
        between each demographic share and earnings relative to the White student baseline. These 
        findings provide strong evidence that this ROI measure disadvantages schools with higher 
        minority populations by confounding return on investment with the effects of 
        prior socioeconomic status.

        Because the OLS model uses the full continuous ROI measure rather than a binary threshold, it retains more information and 
        offers more interpretable estimates of the relationship between demographic composition and ROI. We therefore find 
        its results to be most informative and useful.

      <h2>Calculation Framework</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Earnings Parity:</strong>  
        “This threshold measures whether students of color, students from low-income backgrounds,
        and women reach the median earnings of their systemically more advantaged peers 
        (White students, high-income students, or men).”
        <a href="https://live-postsecondary-value-commission.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PVC-Final-Report-FINAL-7.2.pdf ">(p. 40)</a>

      <p>
        <strong>An institution meets Threshold 2 if both conditions are true:</strong><br/>
        <li>
          Income Equity: The median earnings of its low-income students (from the lowest 
          income tercile) are equal to or greater than those of its high-income students
          (from the highest income tercile) 10 years after enrollment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gender Equity: The median earnings of female graduates are equal to or greater 
          than those of male graduates 10 years after enrollment.

    <h2> Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      While regional labor market conditions and institutional characteristics explain 
      much of the variation in performance on existing ROI frameworks, persistent racial disparities 
      suggest that structural inequities continue to shape the economic 
      value of higher education for 
      students of color.

      <br><br>
      Before we end, we want to address some of the limitations of our work. Assessing the value of institutions through purely economic lens can disregard the soft value that they provide, especially at MSIs, which are especially important for cultural preservation, cultivating identity, and fostering social capital. Working with thresholds presents a unique problem of creating a binary, which can be an oversimplification of the true effect that they provide. Finally, one of the problems we ran into during our work was lack of available data: for example, programs within schools are often not big enough to not be privacy suppressed. We also discovered a lack of data on external factors affecting performance on ROI frameworks (ex. labor market conditions on the county-level).

      <br><br>
      However, we believe that addressing these challenges presents an exciting opportunity for future research and development, and we are excited for the potential of enhancing existing ROI frameworks to better capture the true impact of higher education.

      <br><br>
      
      Summary of the relationship between MSI status/demographics on ROI. 
      Summary of effect of controlling for socioeconomic status (i.e., Pell %) on the model. 
      Discuss usefulness of continuous scale ROI and demographic measures. 
      Summary of implications for future research and policy.
