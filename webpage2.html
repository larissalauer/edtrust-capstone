    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      EdTrust’s mission is to advance policies and practices to dismantle the 
      racial and economic barriers embedded in the American education system. 
      We approached our research project with the purpose of addressing 
      larger systemic issues with American higher education. 
      <br> <br>
      ROI frameworks help prospective students and their families plan for higher education, 
      and so the way in which ROI is calculated and presented to families is extremely 
      important in determining which institutions get more or less funding or resources. 
      Current ROI frameworks focus on a purely economic model (most often, 
      a debt-to-earnings ratio), which neglects student body characteristics that 
      also influence post-graduate success. <br><br> Our research fills a critical gap 
      in existing ROI frameworks by specifically examining how the calculation of ROI changes for
       Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Predominantly White Institutions 
       (PWIs) when controlling for key student body characteristics. Traditional 
       models assess ROI at the institutional or program level but often overlook 
       how institutional type intersects with student demographics, socioeconomic 
       status, and structural barriers like labor market discrimination. By 
       integrating controllable factors like student body characteristics into our 
       analysis, we aim to determine whether disparities in ROI persist due to 
       institutional differences or broader systemic inequities. Our refined 
       approach provides a more accurate and equitable measure of postsecondary 
       value, ensuring a fairer assessment of institutions that serve historically
        underrepresented students. Our findings would not only sharpen ROI 
        calculations but also inform policy debates on funding and resource 
        allocation between MSIs and PWIs.

      <h2>Calculation Framework</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Minimum Economic Return:</strong>  
        “A student meets this threshold if they earn at least as 
        much as a high school graduate plus enough to recoup their 
        total net price plus interest within ten years.”
        <a href="https://live-postsecondary-value-commission.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PVC-Final-Report-FINAL-7.2.pdf ">(p. 40)</a>

        <strong>An institution meets Threshold 0 if:</strong><br/>
        10 * (Median salary after higher education degree) ≥

      <h2>Table of Results and Relevant Variables</h2>
    </section>

    <div id="table-threshold0"></div>
    <h2>Regression Models</h2>
    <p>
      We estimated how controlling for the share of Pell Grant recipients 
      affects the likelihood that different Minority‑Serving Institution (MSI) types meet Threshold 0.
    </p>

        style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem 0;"
    />
    <p>
      <li> Tribal Colleges stand out as being far less likely to meet Threshold 0 than 
      other institutions. This holds true across both the reduced model and model with 
      Pell Grant percentage. The difference is large and meaningful, suggesting that 
      these colleges may be facing major challenges. </li>
      <li>Other types of MSIs (such as HBCUs, HSIs, PBIs, etc.) don’t show strong 
        differences from the baseline; their chances of meeting the benchmark are
         about the same as non-MSI institutions. </li>
      <li>These findings point to possible systemic barriers or underfunding facing 
        Tribal Colleges specifically.</li>
        <br><br> We replace the MSI flags with continuous demographic shares—% Asian, 
        % Black, % Hispanic, etc.—to see how each group’s concentration relates 
        to earnings once Pell % is controlled.

    />

    <p>
      <li>Colleges with higher percentages of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) 
        and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) students are less likely to meet the benchmark.
        These are significant negative effects, meaning they are not likely to be due to chance.</li>

      <li> Schools with more low-income students (Pell Grant recipients) 
      are actually more likely to meet the benchmark.</li>

      <li>
        Other demographics (like Black and Hispanic percentages) show smaller or unclear effects.
        Asian student percentage has a small positive effect—colleges with more Asian 
        students slightly outperform others on this measure.</li>

        <strong>IHEP Earnings Premium:</strong>  
        “A student meets this threshold if they reach at least median earnings in their field of
        study (or, if field of study data is unavailable, the median earnings for the institution’s
        predominant degree type).”
        <a href="https://live-postsecondary-value-commission.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PVC-Final-Report-FINAL-7.2.pdf ">(p. 40)</a>

      <h3>Current Calculations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Earnings Premium:</strong><br/>
          Median post‑enrollment earnings at institution (10 years after entry)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meeting Threshold 1 (binary):</strong><br/>
          Earnings premium ≥ in‑state median earnings for people with bachelor’s degree
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Extensions</h3>
      <p>
        Going forward, you might consider incorporating field‑of‑study data (despite its
        high missingness — 77.5 %) or differentiating by degree type (e.g., bachelor’s vs.
        associate’s) to refine the threshold calculation.

      <h2>Threshold 1: Regression Models</h2>
      <p>
        Next, we estimate how controlling for the share of Pell Grant recipients shifts the relative
        earnings premium across different Minority‑Serving Institution (MSI) types.
      </p>
      <img
        src="Regression Plot_ Earnings Premium MSI.png"
        alt="Regression plot of earnings premium by MSI type"
        style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem 0;"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HBCUs:</strong> Move from underperforming to outperforming non‑MSI schools
          (≈ +$7,000) once Pell % is included.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PBI:</strong> Also see a noticeable improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>HSI &amp; TCU:</strong> Remain largely unchanged.</li>
        <li><strong>ANNHI, NANTI, AANAPII:</strong> Experience a modest decrease (≈ $2,000).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the impact of Pell % is heterogeneous. Because MSI classification is based on
        whether each subgroup exceeds a fixed threshold (typically ≥ 25 %), using continuous
        demographic percentages could yield more nuanced insights than a simple binary flag.
      </p>

    <section id="threshold1-demographics">
      <h2>Threshold 1: Regression Model with Demographics</h2>
      <p>
        We replace the MSI flags with continuous demographic shares—% Asian, % Black,
        % Hispanic, etc.—to see how each group’s concentration relates to earnings once Pell %
        is controlled.

      />
      <p>
        Aside from Asian students, controlling for Pell % amplifies the positive association 
        between each demographic share and earnings relative to the White student baseline.

        “This threshold measures whether students of color, students from low-income backgrounds,

        (White students, high-income students, or men).”

      <p>
        <strong>An institution meets Threshold 2 if both conditions are true:</strong><br/>
        <li>
          Income Equity: The median earnings of its low-income students (from the lowest 
          income tercile) are equal to or greater than those of its high-income students
          (from the highest income tercile) 10 years after enrollment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gender Equity: The median earnings of female graduates are equal to or greater
