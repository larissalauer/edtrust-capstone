    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      EdTrust’s mission is to advance policies and practices to dismantle the racial and economic barriers 
      embedded in the American education system. We approached our research project with the goal of addressing 
      larger systemic issues with American higher education. 
      <br> <br>
      Return on investment (ROI) frameworks inform educational policies and help prospective students and their 
      families plan for higher education, so the way in which ROI is calculated and presented is extremely important
      in determining which institutions receive more or less funding, resources, and students. Current ROI frameworks
      largely focus on a purely economic model (most often, a debt-to-earnings ratio), which neglects student body
      characteristics that also influence post-graduate success.  
      <br><br> 
      Our research fills a critical gap in existing ROI frameworks by specifically examining how the calculation of ROI 
      changes for Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) when controlling for 
      key student body characteristics. Traditional models assess ROI at the institutional or program level but often 
      overlook how institutional type intersects with student demographics, socioeconomic status, and structural barriers 
      like labor market discrimination. By integrating factors like student body characteristics into our analysis, we aim 
      to determine whether disparities in ROI persist due to institutional differences or broader systemic inequities. 
      Our refined approach provides a more accurate and equitable measure of postsecondary value, ensuring a fairer 
      assessment of institutions that serve historically underrepresented students. Our findings would not only sharpen ROI 
      calculations but also inform policy debates on funding and resource allocation between MSIs and PWIs.

    <h1 id="scorecard">Institution-Level Dataset</h1>
    
    <p>
      The following dataset provides information on the ROI of colleges and universities in the United States for each 
      framework of interest. We include other relevant variables, such as the percentage of students receiving Pell 
      Grants (an indicator of socioeconomic status), MSI type, and racial demographics. We primarily relied on 
      <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">College Scorecard data</a> 
      to construct this dataset and calculate the measures of ROI. 
    <p> 
      <h2>How to Use This Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        You can sort the columns of this table in ascending order and descending order to see which institutions have the 
        most extreme values. If you are interested in recreating or further developing our regression analysis, click 
        “Download Dataset” below the table to save a copy of it to your device.
        <br><br>
        Prospective students and parents may also be interested in the ROI of specific schools. These schools can also be 
        found using the search bar. See the discussion below for details on interpreting specific ROI frameworks. 
        <br><br>
        We want to caution against blindly relying on ROI measures as indicators of a school’s quality or of the return 
        a student should expect from attending. Indeed, a central finding of our research is that existing ROI frameworks 
        can conflate the individual return on investment a student can realistically expect with the advantages already conferred 
        by their socioeconomic background. In other words, a high ROI may indicate that an institution effectively contributes to 
        student success and career outcomes or that its student body comes from backgrounds that often lead to higher earnings 
        regardless of the institution attended. In the absence of detailed individual-level data on earnings, background, and 
        college of attendance, more work is needed to produce informative and accurate measures of ROI that do not rely on 
        questionable assumptions.

      <p>
        <strong>Minimum Economic Return:</strong>  
        “A student meets this threshold if they earn at least as 
        much as a high school graduate plus enough to recoup their 
        total net price plus interest within ten years.”

    <div id="table-threshold0"></div>
    <h2>Regression Models</h2>
    <p>
      We estimated how controlling for the share of Pell Grant recipients 
      affects the likelihood that different Minority‑Serving Institution (MSI) types meet Threshold 0.
    </p>

        style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem 0;"
    />
    <p>
      <li> Tribal Colleges stand out as being far less likely to meet Threshold 0 than 
      other institutions. This holds true across both the reduced model and model with 
      Pell Grant percentage. The difference is large and meaningful, suggesting that 
      these colleges may be facing major challenges. </li>
      <li>Other types of MSIs (such as HBCUs, HSIs, PBIs, etc.) don’t show strong 
        differences from the baseline; their chances of meeting the benchmark are
         about the same as non-MSI institutions. </li>
      <li>These findings point to possible systemic barriers or underfunding facing 
        Tribal Colleges specifically.</li>
        <br><br> We replace the MSI flags with continuous demographic shares—% Asian, 
        % Black, % Hispanic, etc.—to see how each group’s concentration relates 
        to earnings once Pell % is controlled.

    />

    <p>
      <li>Colleges with higher percentages of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) 
        and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) students are less likely to meet the benchmark.
        These are significant negative effects, meaning they are not likely to be due to chance.</li>

      <li> Schools with more low-income students (Pell Grant recipients) 
      are actually more likely to meet the benchmark.</li>

      <li>
        Other demographics (like Black and Hispanic percentages) show smaller or unclear effects.
        Asian student percentage has a small positive effect—colleges with more Asian 
        students slightly outperform others on this measure.</li>

        <strong>IHEP Earnings Premium:</strong>  
        “A student meets this threshold if they reach at least median earnings in their field of
        study (or, if field of study data is unavailable, the median earnings for the institution’s
        predominant degree type).”

      <h3>Current Calculations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Earnings Premium:</strong><br/>
          Median post‑enrollment earnings at institution (10 years after entry)
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Extensions</h3>
      <p>
        Going forward, you might consider incorporating field‑of‑study data (despite its
        high missingness — 77.5 %) or differentiating by degree type (e.g., bachelor’s vs.
        associate’s) to refine the threshold calculation.

      <h2>Threshold 1: Regression Models</h2>
      <p>
        Next, we estimate how controlling for the share of Pell Grant recipients shifts the relative
        earnings premium across different Minority‑Serving Institution (MSI) types.
      </p>
      <img
        src="Regression Plot_ Earnings Premium MSI.png"

      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HBCUs:</strong> Move from underperforming to outperforming non‑MSI schools
          (≈ +$7,000) once Pell % is included.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PBI:</strong> Also see a noticeable improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>HSI &amp; TCU:</strong> Remain largely unchanged.</li>
        <li><strong>ANNHI, NANTI, AANAPII:</strong> Experience a modest decrease (≈ $2,000).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the impact of Pell % is heterogeneous. Because MSI classification is based on
        whether each subgroup exceeds a fixed threshold (typically ≥ 25 %), using continuous
        demographic percentages could yield more nuanced insights than a simple binary flag.

    <section id="threshold1-demographics">
      <h2>Threshold 1: Regression Model with Demographics</h2>
      <p>
        We replace the MSI flags with continuous demographic shares—% Asian, % Black,
        % Hispanic, etc.—to see how each group’s concentration relates to earnings once Pell %
        is controlled.

      <p>
        Aside from Asian students, controlling for Pell % amplifies the positive association 
        between each demographic share and earnings relative to the White student baseline.
